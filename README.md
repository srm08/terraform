Run terraform apply to apply the configuration and provision the resources.

After the apply is complete, Terraform will output the public IP address of the newly created EC2 instance.

Make sure you have valid AWS credentials set up on your local machine, or configure them via the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
